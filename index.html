        <p class="aboutPersonalText">
          Hello! I am JohnHenry, and I'd like to first thank you for visiting my website. I'm doing this so that you
          can learn a little bit more about me. I am from Seattle, Washington and am currently attending Western
          Washington Univeristy where I am working towards a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. You can read more about my experience with Computer Science in the "Life in CS" column. <br>
          I enjoy watching and playing soccer and football, but my favorite sport is baseball. I played baseball from
          about the age of 5 up through High School. Being from Seattle, I'm a big fan of the Mariners, Sounders,
          Seahawks, and Huskies, even though I don't attend UW. <br>
          I also love wataching movies, and I am extremely passionate about Marvel movies. I'll go see them the night
          they come out in theaters, and really enjoy talking about what they'll do next and how intricate the Marvel
          Cinematic Universe is. Some of my other favorite movies are The Shining, Life of Pi, and Planet of the Apes. Apart from movies, some of my favorite TV shows are New Girl, Bob's Burgers, American Horror Story, and Game of Thrones. <br>
          I would really love to travel in the future, as I haven't done much travelling so far in my life. Some places
          that I'm most interested in visiting are Japan, Australia, France, and Scandanavia. <br>
          Thank you again for taking the time to visit my website, and I hope you were able to learn a little more about me!

          Life in CS
        </h6>
        <p class="aboutTechnicalText">
          My only prior experience to Computer Science before college was one class I took my freshman year of high school. I don't remember the name of it, or really much of what we did, but I do remember codeing a pacman ghost that would follow the cursor around the screen. I remember really enjoying that class, but not really thinking much about computer science until the end of my senior year in high school, but I think that that one class I took freshman year sparked something for me that I didn't realize at the time.<br><br>
          Before I signed up for my first quarter at WWU, I decided that I was going to give Computer Science a shot. I knew that it was a quickly growing field with lots of opportunities to have an impact on soceity and I wanted to be a part of that. After taking my first introductory class, I was hooked. I love solving all the problems that arise in CS, how big everything seems but how small it can be broken down to, and how there can be multiple solutions to a problem.<br><br>
          Now I am in my third year at WWU, and am looking forward to all the fascinating classes that are ahead of me. I can't wait to work with a team solving problems and creating programs. I also have some personal project ideas that I hope to work on, and look forward to the challenges that those may present. I'm very happy with my choice of becoming a Computer Scientist, and am always looking forward to my furture as one.

        <p class="internshipText">
          I became a  Computer Science Peer Mentor at WWU at the beginning of my junior year. I decided to become a mentor to help students who, like me, had little to no experience in Computer Science at the beginning of their college career. I knew what it was like to not have any ideas on what to do, and feel a bit lost, so I wanted to do anything I could to help others in that situation. <br><br>
          Being a mentor also gets me involved in presenting workshops to students. Some of the workshop topics that mentors have presented include API's, Machine Learning, Version Control, Bash, and Success in CS.<br><br>
          One thing that I didn't think being a Peer Montor would give to me is the opprotunity to practice my CS skills. Helping other students who are encountering problems that I once did allows me to sharpen my skills and have the fundamentals nailed down. Becoming a Peer Mentor was one of the best decisions I made at WWU.

          Some of the classes I've taken at WWU are Object Oriented Design, Data Structures, Algorithm Analysis, and Databases, along with Multivariable Calculus, Limits and Infinite series, and Probabilty. I'll soon be entering into Senior Project classes where I will be collabroating with my peers on some exciting projects. <br><br>
          I've been enjoying my time at WWU, and am thankful for all the people I have met. I feel as though I am a part of a great community of students and professors here, and am lucky to be around so many amazing individuals at WWU.

          I am currently looking for an internship for Summer 2021. by then I will have just 1 quarter left at WWU, and landing an internship for the summer will give me a large stepping stone into finding a full time job after graduation.<br><br>
          At an internship, I hope to be a contributing member to a team, learn what life is like in the industry, and
          continue to develop my CS and problem solving skills. If I would also be able to learn about a new language or
          framework on the job, that would be very interesting to me and a fun challenge.<br><br>
          If you or someone you know is looking for possible interns in a Computer Science related field, feel free to
          reach out to me, even if you're not sure if it'd be an exact fit for my experience or interests, I'd still be
          interested in seeing what kind of work they'd have me do.

            This project was built using the C language, taking advantage of C system calls, as well as using C's pointer focused design and memory allocation for storing commands in arrays. It's main use is to read commands from the command line and appropriatly execute it. The Microshell can handle many different commands from the terminal command line that most shells can handle.<br><br>
            This project helped me understand the UNIX operating system, gain experience writing C code, and helped me understand programming topics like pointers, system vs library calls, and memeory. You can follow the github link to see a more in depth description of the commands possible in my Microshell.

            This project is the largest project I have ever accomplished. I worked on it with another student at WWU, and it took us about 2 months to complete. It began as a text based version of the board game Deadwood, and we integrated it to work as a GUI based version. It can be played with 2-8 players.<br><br>
            This project helped me understand object oriented design, as well as how to work on a software in a team. The utilization of a version control software, Github, really helped us keep things in order, and was a great learning experience and gave me some insight into how a real world software could be created. This is definitly my favorite project I've made, and it gave me a lot of ideas for future projects as well.

          This website originally stemmed from a final project in my MIS 314 class, and I wanted to take the project further than what was assigned. I designed the concept for the website in Adobe Xd, which I
          had some experience with before hand so it was fun and challenging to proactice a new technology. I also used Xampp so that I could work on the PHP functionality locally.<br><br>
          Once I had some basic design ideas built, I began to build the site, first using HTML5 and CSS3. I
          used some CSS stylings such grid and flexbox, and once I had the HTML styled, I began to implement actual functionality using PHP and SQL.<br><br>
          The website uses nine different tables that are read from a database using SQL queries. Rows in these tables can be crated, removed, updated, and deleted. This was my first project uisng PHP and SQL and I had a lot of fun doing it. I understand how websites like Amazon.com work, and feel confident that I could produce a function online shopping website for a company.
